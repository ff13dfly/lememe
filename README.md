# Lememe

The **Lememe** introduces a **decentralized, gamified mechanism** to enable the creation and launch of memecoins on blockchain networks. The system combines the thrill of lottery participation with fair and transparent token distribution while leveraging DeFi mechanics for liquidity pool creation and trading.

## **Problem Statement**

The memecoin trend has become a massive driver of community engagement in the blockchain space, yet launching new tokens is often restricted to developers with technical expertise. Current challenges include:

1. **Lack of Fair Distribution**: Early adopters often monopolize token launches, limiting community participation.
2. **Engagement and Liquidity**: Most token launches lack mechanisms to simultaneously build community interest and establish liquidity.
3. **Barriers to Entry**: Token creation is still complex for non-technical users.

### **Lememe Solution**

The **Lememe** democratizes the token launch process, offering an all-in-one platform to:

1. **Enable Token Creation**: Allow anyone to create a new token by uploading an image and a name.
2. **Implement Gamified Lotteries**: Users participate in a lottery which is created automatically by system to win token allocations, fostering excitement and fair distribution.
3. **Build Liquidity Pools**: Automate liquidity creation for new tokens by selling tickets of the lottery.
4. **Boost Ecosystem Growth**: Encourage community participation, improve token distribution transparency, and drive liquidity.

### **Lememe Architecture**

#### **1. Lottery Memecoin Creation**

- Users upload an image and provide token name.

- The system generates and deploys an lottery for user. Total 100 winners of the 1/100,000 chance determines.

#### **2. Gamified Lottery**

- Users pay a one-time entry fee (e.g., USDT or DOT) to participate in the lottery.

- Winners will receive 80% of the initial token supply.

- Remaining participants share 20% of the tokens, ensuring fair distribution.

#### **3. Liquidity Pool Deployment**

- Collected ticket fees are used to create liquidity pools (e.g., Token/DOT) via integrated DeFi protocols (like HydraDX or Polkadot-native AMMs).

- Liquidity pools are launched after 30% of tickets are minted, enabling trading while lotteries continue.

#### **4. Staged Token Distribution**

- **Stage 1**: After 30% of tickets are minted, 50% of the token supply is distributed.

- **Stage 2**: Once all tickets are minted, the remaining 50% is distributed using the same mechanism.
